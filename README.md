## Simple Data Pipeline

{Space to display clean data}

Hello Semin and others at Next Gate Tech,

Please find in this repo my code for the data pipeline task.
There were a lot of bits that I wanted to refine and I've left some other ideas in the comments.
I have tried to follow the best practices I've so far been exposed to as best as I could.
This was my first time looking at and learning about APIs. Unfortunately I wasn't quite able to make it work,
but I'll be taking another look at it over the coming days.

P.S. I've had to leave the repo as public in order to have the GitHub Pages

Thanks,
Lucca
